# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is designed to be played between two players, taking turns to place their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three aligned marks, the game ends in a draw.
